I want to write a simple program that opens a pop up window with message after a set time using the command line.
The purpose is to use it as a simple alarm. For example, if I want to have a one hour coding session, I can use the program like this:
python main.py --hours 1 --message "1-Hour coding session completed" &
will result in a pop window in the top right corner displaying  "message" and the elapsed time.

The program works as intended as of now on my system.
